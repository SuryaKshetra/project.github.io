# Business cases integrated with SDG 11 

## Case 1:-
### Integration of small-sized apartments with smart features like solar equipped-
These small-sized apartments can be built in unused spaces like small-untraversable gulleys, under train bridges, etc which ensures efficient use of space in a city
also providing adequate living space for everyone at cheap costs since the houses are built on a very small area of land.

This case caters to 11.1 of SDG 11 3.

Algorithms like segment trees can be used to calculate unused areas on a land where each node acts as a region of land.

These areas can then be used to build these tiny apartments.
These apartments usually accomodate atmost 1-2 persons at a time for everyday living. Some of these can be seen in japan which has very little usable land compared 
to a country like india. The houses can be essentially built by the government in sets for use or the land can be sold for the use of building.

## Case 2:-
### Using piezoelectric plates/footholds to produce electricity-
Using this technology smart roads and highways can be built which acts as an alternate efficient source of electricity from all the unused kinetic energy from the
vehicles and people walking on platforms.

This alternate source of electricity can be sold to different businesses and accomation of these plates can act as a source of revenue by providing smart energy
solution to large facilities like malls,etc.
It can also help reduce cost of electricity and promote eco friendly systems.

data structure Algorithms like graphs can be used to track spaces/areas with most of these high kinetic regions and used to build plates on those areas.

## Case 3:-
### Smart Governance and Civic Engagement-
Smart governance involves the use of digital platforms to enhance citizen engagement, improve service delivery, and foster transparency in urban management.
These technologies enable cities to be more responsive and accountable to their citizens.

Algorithms like advanced blockchain systems can be used to make the platform more secure and safe to use since it encompasses the whole popukation and power of a country.
