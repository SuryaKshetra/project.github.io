## Integration of small-sized apartments with smart features like solar equipped-
The idea is to build small-sized apartments equipped with smart features such as solar panels on previously unused or difficult-to-utilize land spaces. These spaces could include small gulleys, areas under train bridges, or narrow urban gaps. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Efficient Use of Urban Space**: By utilizing underused land, such as narrow passages or gaps between buildings, we can make more room for living spaces in crowded cities.
- **Affordable Housing**: Since these apartments occupy small areas, they can be built at a much lower cost compared to traditional housing. This makes them an attractive solution for providing affordable housing in cities with limited land.
- **Sustainability**: Incorporating smart features such as solar panels allows these buildings to be eco-friendly and sustainable.

A **Segment Tree** is an ideal data structure for managing range queries and updates, especially when working with intervals or regions of land. For this case, each node in the tree could represent a region of land, and the tree would allow us to efficiently calculate the available land in a given range.

- **Range Queries**: You can use the segment tree to query for available space in a specific region of land (e.g., find all gaps of unused land between certain coordinates).
- **Dynamic Updates**: When land is used for constructing apartments, the segment tree can be updated to reflect the change in land status.
- **Efficiency**: Segment trees provide `O(log n)` time complexity for both querying and updating, making them very efficient for applications with dynamic data, such as this one.
Code for segment tree can be seen here [Segment tree code](#segment_tree.cpp)

**Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) / Fenwick Tree**
#### Explanation:
A **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)** is another efficient data structure that supports range queries and updates, though it is typically used for simpler tasks. It might not offer as much flexibility as a segment tree for dynamic range updates, but it is a viable option for smaller or simpler land tracking applications.

- **Range Sum Queries**: BIT excels in scenarios where cumulative sum queries are needed, such as finding the total unused land in a specific range.
- **Efficient Updates**: BIT provides efficient updates to land status, although it might not be as effective as a segment tree when working with more complex data or larger datasets.

**Sorting**
Before using more advanced data structures like segment trees, sorting the land intervals can help organize the data and make it easier to perform further operations like merging intervals or searching for available land.
Once the intervals are sorted, you can use binary search or linear scans to quickly identify gaps of available land or where new apartments can be built.
Some simple sorting algorithm can be used from [Sorting reference code](#sorting.cpp)

A **Greedy Algorithm** is ideal when you need to select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals. After sorting the intervals, a greedy approach can help select the largest possible number of available land regions for construction.


## Using piezoelectric plates/footholds to produce electricity-
In the era of sustainable energy, utilizing existing infrastructure like roads and highways for energy generation is an innovative approach. **Piezoelectric plates**, which generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress (such as pressure from vehicles or foot traffic), can be embedded in roads, highways, and pedestrian pathways. The primary objective of this technology is to harness kinetic energy from vehicles and pedestrians and convert it into usable electricity.

### Benefits of Piezoelectric Roads:
- **Alternative Energy Source**: The kinetic energy generated by the movement of vehicles and people can be captured and converted into electricity.
- **Revenue Generation**: The electricity produced can be sold to businesses, helping reduce electricity costs. Facilities like malls, airports, and large buildings can benefit from this energy source.
- **Eco-Friendly**: By reducing reliance on conventional energy sources, this technology helps lower carbon footprints and promotes sustainable, eco-friendly systems.
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduced dependency on the grid, leading to lower electricity costs for urban facilities.

This system can also act as a **smart energy solution** for cities by providing an efficient and clean energy source.

## Data Structures and Algorithms for Smart Roads and Piezoelectric Plates-

### Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is a graph algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It can be applied here to optimize the routing of energy from the **piezoelectric plates** to the energy storage or grid system.

#### Use Case:
- **Energy Transmission Optimization**: Once piezoelectric plates are installed in high-kinetic zones, we need to route the generated electricity efficiently to the storage system or businesses. Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to compute the **shortest path** between energy collection points and storage locations, minimizing the energy loss due to long transmission paths.
Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Code for it can found here [djikstra code](https://github.com/SuryaKshetra/project.github.io/edit/main/Ravi/algorithms_in_business_cases.md#segment_tree.cpp)

## QuickSort or MergeSort
Sorting algorithms can help in organizing road segments or regions based on traffic patterns or kinetic energy potential. Sorting these regions by traffic intensity (or by kinetic energy produced) ensures that piezoelectric plates are installed in areas that maximize energy production.

#### Use Case:
- Suppose you have a set of road segments, each with different levels of foot traffic or vehicle movement. Sorting these segments by energy generation potential allows you to install piezoelectric plates in the highest-traffic areas first.
