# Course - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

The course is designed to understand how real world entities help us in solving computational problems and also develop analytical skills.It also helps to understand the method of solving the problem which leads to finding better solutions in terms of efficiency.

#Data Structures And Algorithms Studied
-Different types of trees n-ary trees, AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Trie, Skip list, segment trees, lookup table, Fenwick trees, Heap, Graphs
-Many Algorithms that include different Sorting algorithms like Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap sort. String search algorithms like Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp. Different algorithms to solve Graph problems like Krushkal, Dijkstra, Floyd, Prim's etc.

-We connect the course with real time applications by understanding how the algorithms are connected to
