# Course Reflections By Veeresh

## What are the kinds of problems we see in the nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking) 
-

## What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different class of problems and orders of growth 
- 

## Take away from different design principles from chapter 2 (can use the notes provided) 
- 

## The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over the problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
-

## The need of array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed 
-

## Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each
-

## Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and they connect to real world
-

## Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths
-

## Discuss about the different studied algorithm design techniques.
