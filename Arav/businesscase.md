1. Green Spaces
Business Case:
Urban greenery improves air quality, reduces urban heat islands, and enhances the well-being of residents. Integrating green spaces in city planning fosters environmental sustainability and promotes public health, increasing property value and attracting businesses.

Alignment with SDG 11 Targets:
11.7: By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities
11.7.1:Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities
11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management

2. EV Charging Infrastructure
Business Case:
A robust EV infrastructure reduces dependency on fossil fuels, supports clean energy adoption, and enhances public transport efficiency, attracting investments in EV manufacturing and operations.

Alignment with SDG 11 Targets:
11.2: By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all.
11.6: Reduce the environmental impact of cities by promoting clean energy

Relevant Algorithms:
Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Compute the shortest paths between residential/commercial zones and potential EV charging stations.
Prioritize locations within specific travel-time thresholds.

3. Tourism
Business Case:
Promoting tourism boosts local economies, generates employment, and enhances cultural preservation. Sustainable tourism reduces environmental strain while maximizing socio-economic benefits.

Alignment with SDG 11 Targets:
11.4: Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard cultural and natural heritage.
11.a: Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning.

Relevant Algorithms:
Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford): Identify the most efficient routes connecting tourist hotspots.
