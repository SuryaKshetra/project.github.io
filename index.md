# Introduction

The course is designed to understand how real-world entities help us in solving computational problems and also develop analytical skills.  
It also helps to understand the method of solving the problem, which leads to finding better solutions in terms of efficiency.

## Data Structures And Algorithms Studied

### Data Structures
- **Trees**: n-ary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Skip List, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees  
- **Graphs**: Directed, undirected, weighted graphs, and also adjacency matrix and adjacency list  
- **Heap** (min/max), lookup tables, etc.

### Algorithms
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort  
- **String Search Algorithms**: Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp  
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Krushkal, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Prim's, etc.

## Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications

We connect the course with real-time applications by applying the algorithms in the course project of city design.  
By understanding the design principles behind the algorithms, we implement them to solve problems faced in designing a city.

# Course Project Introduction

Suryakshetra is a meticulously planned urban area spanning 1,500 sq. km in Gujarat, strategically chosen to leverage its proximity to established cities like Rajkot, Porbandar, and Junagadh. This city model aspires to balance growth, sustainability, and livability while addressing key challenges of urbanization in India.
