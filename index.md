# Introduction
The course is designed to understand how real world entities help us in solving computational problems and also develop analytical skills.It also helps to understand the method of solving the problem which leads to finding better solutions in terms of efficiency.

## Data Structures And Algorithms Studied
### Data Structures
-Trees: n-ary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Skip List, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
-Graphs: directed, undirected, weighted graphs and also adjacency matrix and adjacency list
-Heap(min/max), lookup tables etc.

### Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort
String search Algorithms: Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp.
Different graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Krushkal, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Prim's etc.

## Connecting the course with real time Applications
-We connect the course with real time applications by applying the algorithms in the course project of city design. By understanding the design principles behind the algorithms we implement it problem faced in designing a city.
