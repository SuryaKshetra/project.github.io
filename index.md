# Introduction

The course is designed to understand how real-world entities help us in solving computational problems and also develop analytical skills.  
It also helps to understand the method of solving the problem, which leads to finding better solutions in terms of efficiency.

## Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications

We connect the course with real-time applications by applying the algorithms in the course project of city design.  
By understanding the design principles behind the algorithms, we implement them to solve problems faced in designing a city.

# Course Project Introduction

Suryakshetra is a well planned urban smart city with area of 1500 sq.km in Gujarat, it is strategically chosen as its proximity to established cities like Rajkot, Porbandar, and Junagadh.<br>
This city model aspires to balance growth, sustainability, and livability while addressing key challenges of urbanization in India.<br>
Aligning with the Government of Indiaâ€™s mission to promote sustainable and inclusive cities, Suryakshetra will integrate smart technologies, improve urban infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life.
